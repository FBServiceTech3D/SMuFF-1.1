# Configuration Files

Copy these files onto the SMuFFs SD-Card **root folder** (/) before you start it up.

The filenames are supposed to be self explanatory.

**EEPROM.json** is the file where the SMuFF will store some parameters at runtime, similar to storing data in EEPROM, except, the format of the content is JSON, just like all the other files.

**Please notice:** *You don't have to modify the contents manually since they're covered by the menus and GCode interface, though you can if you feel the urge to do so.
Just use some sort of JSON editor in order to ensure the file format doesn't get messed up, which will eventually render the file useless.*
